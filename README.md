This project is a minimalist personal homepage created using only HTML and CSS, without any frameworks. The homepage features a clean design that showcases personal information, a table of relevant data, and a gallery of external links.

## Features

- **Semantic HTML5**: The structure of the homepage utilizes semantic elements such as `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<figure>`, and `<table>` for better accessibility and SEO.
- **Responsive Design**: The CSS is designed to be responsive, ensuring that the layout adapts to different screen sizes using max-width properties and CSS Grid/Flexbox.
- **Color Contrast**: The color scheme is chosen to provide good contrast for readability.
- **System Fonts**: The design uses system fonts for a clean and modern look.

## File Structure
